% QUATERNION  Help on quaternions for the Rotations/ toolbox.
%   
%   We specify a quaternion with a unit, column 4-vector
%
%       q = [a b c d]' , norm(q) = 1.
%
%   with [a] the real part and [b c d]' the imaginary parts. This is
%   equivalent to writing the true quaternion in quaternion space
%
%       q = a + bi + cj + dk, 
%
%   with
%
%       i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, ij = k, ji = -k,
%
%   which corresponds to the Hamilton convention for quaternions.
%
%   NOTE on convention: Please be careful not to mix formulas in this
%   toolbox using the quaternion, with other quaternion formulas you can
%   find elsewhere! If needed, please make sure that you are both using the
%   Hamilton convention!
%
%   NOTE on notation: The products performed in quaternion space are
%   indicated with a dot as in (q1.q2). Matrix products are with a star
%   (A*v).
%
%   Quaternions are used for encoding rotations and orientations with the
%   Hamilton convention, depicted as follows:
%
%       1. Consider a world or global frame W and a local frame F.
%
%       2. q is used to encode the orientation of frame F wrt frame W. It
%       may be written as q_WF.
%
%       3. q is also used to transform vectors from frame F to frame W.
%
%       4. Consider now a vector v = vx.i + vy.j + vz.k in quaternion
%       space.
%
%       5. We name v_W and v_F the coordinates of v respectively in frames
%       W and F.
%
%       6. Then, if q_FW = q_WF' := a - bi - cj - dk is the conjugate of
%       q_WF, we have
%           v_W = q_WF . v_F . q_FW = q_WF . v_F . q_WF'
%           v_F = q_FW . v_W . q_WF = q_FW . v_W . q_FW'
%
%       7. This is equivalent to the linear, rotation matrix forms 
%           V_W = R_WF * V_F
%           V_F = R_FW * V_W , 
%       with 
%           V_W, V_F         : the same vectors in Euclidean 3d-space
%           R_WF = q2R(q_WF) : the rotation matrix
%           R_FW = R_WF'.    : the transposed rotation matrix.
%
%   Some interesting functions involving quaternions are:
%
%       q2qc    conjugate quaternion,      q' = q2qc(q).
%       qProd   product of quaternions, q1.q2 = qProd(q1,q2)
%       q2Q     quaternion matrix,      q1.q2 = q2Q(q1)*q2
%       q2R     rotation matrix. We name R(q) = q2R(q), with the properties:
%           R(q1.q2) = R(q1) * R(q2)
%           R(q')    = R(q)'
%           R(-q)    = R(q)
%       q2e     quaternion to Euler angles conversion
%       q2v     quaternion to rotation vector conversion
%       R2q, e2q, v2q  inverses of q2R, q2e and q2v.
%       qpredict constant angular velocity prediction model.
%
%   Most of these functions are equipped with Jacobian computation for
%   their use in algorithms requiring linearization, such as EKF.
