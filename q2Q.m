function Q = q2Q(q)

% Q2Q  Quaternion to quaternion matrix conversion.
%   Q = Q2Q(q) gives the matrix Q so that the quaternion product
%   q1 x q2 is equivalent to the matrix product:
%
%       q1 x q2 == q2Q(q1) * q2
%
%   If q = [a b c d]' this matrix is
%
%       Q = [ a -b -c -d
%             b  a -d  c
%             c  d  a -b
%             d -c  b  a ];
%
